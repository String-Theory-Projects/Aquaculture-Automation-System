## New Tasks After Dashboard App Deprecation

- [x] Update Swagger documentation to reflect new modular app structure
- [x] Verify all API endpoints are properly documented with new URLs
- [x] Test feed event logging endpoint at `/automation/feed/log-event/`
- [x] Ensure all management commands are properly documented
- [x] Update any remaining references to old dashboard app in documentation

## MQTT Configuration Cleanup

- [x] Remove deprecated .env.local file and references
- [x] Update core constants to use actual working MQTT configuration
- [x] Align MQTT client with device-level topic structure
- [x] Update documentation to reflect actual working topics
- [x] Create comprehensive MQTT testing guide
- [x] Remove python-dotenv dependency

## API Structure Improvements

- [x] Convert execute_feed_command to DRF APIView (ExecuteFeedCommandView)
- [x] Convert execute_water_command to DRF APIView (ExecuteWaterCommandView)
- [x] Fix JWT authentication issues with control endpoints
- [x] Update URL configuration and naming conventions
- [x] Update documentation to reflect new API structure

## Next Steps

- [x] Test MQTT communication with actual devices
- [x] Verify feed control commands work end-to-end (Fixed with DRF APIView)
- [ ] Test automation triggers via MQTT sensor data
- [ ] Implement pond-level topics if needed (currently using device-level)
